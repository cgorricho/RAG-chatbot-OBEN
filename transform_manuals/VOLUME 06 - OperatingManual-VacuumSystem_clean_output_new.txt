2 Function

The following figures show examples. The figures are not necessarily identical toyour line.IntroductionThis chapter contains information on the intended use and the description of the ba-sic functions of the machine and its components. Here, above all, those functionsthat are necessary for the operation and the maintenance have been taken into ac-count.2.1 Intended useIntended useThe vacuum system provides negative pressure on the vacuum dome of the ex-truder. This suctions out the gases.The machine is contractually specified by parameters and must only be operatedwithin them.DisclaimerAny use that goes beyond the designated use is forbidden. Brückner accepts no li-ability for any consequential damage. Improper use can present danger to life andlimb, the machine and connected equipment, and to the efficient operation of themachine.

Risk assessment andwork instructions

The operating company has to carry out a risk assessment and create operating in-structions for the handling of the machine.Inputs listed in this operating manual for personal protective equipment are basedon the risk assessment taking into consideration the experience with film productionand film stretching lines. The actually occurring hazards can deviate in individualcases. In this case, the measures of the hazard assessment of the operating com-pany must be taken into consideration and applied.

4 Vacuum pump unit

5 Separator6 Melt separator7 Extruder2.2.2 Vacuum systemDue to the high temperatures in the extruder (7), gases escape from the polymerwith volatile additives, monomer residues and moisture. The vacuum system, com-prising melt separator (6), separator (5) and vacuum pump unit (4), provides negat-ive pressure on the vacuum dome (1) of the extruder (7). Through this, the gasesare extracted via heated vacuum piping (2) and non-heated vacuum piping (3). Themelt separator (6) prevents melt from rising into the vacuum system.Due to the extraction of the gases in the extruder, a high melt quality is achievedeven with more moist granulate.

Due to the vacuum pumps (10, 12) a negative pressure is created, which suctionsthe gases out of the vacuum dome of the extruder through the vacuum system viathe vacuum piping (1). Due to the gas compression in the vacuum pumps, the gas isheated by the process.The heated gas is cooled down in the intermediate cooler (11). The intermediatecooler (11) is connected to the cooling water supply (6) via pipes.The exhaust air is led away through the exhaust air collecting line (8).To remove deposits in the vacuum pump unit, the screw vacuum pumps (10) mustbe flushed regularly. The screw vacuum pumps (10) are flushed and dried automat-ically. From the container (7), purging liquid is fed into the screw vacuumpumps (10) via the purging liquid pipe (8), thereby cleaning the screw vacuumpumps (10). By automatically opening a solenoid valve, air flows in and the screwvacuum pumps (10) are dried. The container with the purging liquid (7) and the ex-haust air collection pipe (9) are equipped with filling level sensors that are connec-ted to the process control system.The temperature in the switch cabinet (3) is regulated by a heat exchanger (4). Theheat exchanger is connected to the cooling water supply (5) via pipes.2.2.11 Exhaust air ductThe exhaust air is conducted into the atmosphere.2.2.12 Switch cabinetThe switch cabinet is located at the vacuum pump unit.The switch cabinets are cooled by a heat exchanger that is operated with coolingwater.2.2.13 Measuring of pressureIn the vacuum system, the pressure is continuously monitored by pressure trans-ducers connected to the Process Control System.2.2.14 Temperature measurementIn the vacuum system, the temperature is continuously monitored by temperaturesensors connected to the Process Control System.2.3 Process control system
