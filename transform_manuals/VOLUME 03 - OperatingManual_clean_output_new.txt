3 Film productionIntroductionThe purpose of your Brückner line is to produce biaxially oriented (abbreviated BO)flat film in a two-stage process.Biaxially oriented means that the film is stretched in two main directions at an angleof 90°.These two main directions are:• The longitudinal direction, called machine direction (abbreviated MD).• The transverse direction (abbreviated TD).The film is stretched in a two-stage process:• Firstly, in machine direction (MD).• Secondly, in transverse direction (TD).3.1 Components of the film production line3.1.1 From the raw material to the cast film3.1.1.1 Material storage and transportBig BagsThe raw material is delivered in big bags. These big bags are loaded in the raw ma-terial reception, i.e. the big bag reception.

Single screw ex-truders

If single screw extruders are used, the raw material is to be dried before it is fed intothe main extruder respectively a coextruder:• Main extruderThe raw material is transported from the raw material feeding hopper via themixing and dosing system to the crystalliser and dryer. From the main dryer thegranulate is transported to the main extruder.• CoextruderThe raw material transport to the coextruder(s) is effected via a separate mixingand dosing unit to the coextrusion dryer.

Twin screw extruderIn case of twin screw extruders, no dryer is necessary. The material is degassed inthe twin screw extruder using vacuum systems.3.1.1.2 Extrusion systemMelt flowThe melt flow from the main extruder as well as from the coextruder(s) passesthrough the metering pumps, the filters, the adapter block to the melt die unit. Theindividual melt streams flow together either in the multilayer adapter block or in themultilayer melt nozzle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 16 
ComponentsThe extrusion system contains the following components:• Main extruder• Coextruder(s)• Filters for the melt flow• Melt pump (optional)• Melt die unitExtruderThe extruder is used to melt granules and pressurise melt. The extruder is designedfor processing only those materials that are described in the technical data sheetsand in the process manual and may only be operated with these materials.Melt die unitThe melt die unit is arranged between the extrusion system and film casting unit. Itmainly consists of the frame, die support, melt die and adapter block.The melt die unit guides the melt out of the extrusion system over the chill roll as afilm. In the multilayer adapter block or the melt nozzle, the individual melt streamsflow together and are distributed from above through the lip gap of the melt nozzleonto the chill roll.3.1.1.3 Film casting unitIntroductionIn the film casting unit, the melt film of the melt die is cooled by a chill roll and, ascast film, directed to the next components.ComponentsThe film casting unit includes:• Chill roll and take-off roll• Electrostatic lay-on device• Cast film thickness gauge (optional)• Auxiliary winder (optional)• Film casting stand

Functional descrip-tion

It is the purpose of the film casting unit to draw the melt from the melt die unit and tostabilise the melt by cooling it down. This is achieved by means of a big cooling roll,called a "chill roll".In order to apply the melt perfectly to the chill roll, the so-called "feeder system" isused. It consists of movable electrodes that are connected to high voltage to pressthe melt evenly and bubble-free onto the chill roll.At the end of the casting unit an auxiliary winder (optional) is installed.The now available cast film is conveyed from here to the following machine.For the cast film tolerances, the (optional) cast film thickness gauge is arrangedafter the chill roll.

3.1.2 Stretching3.1.2.1 Machine direction orienterIntroductionThe machine direction orienter (MDO) serves to stretch the so far unstretched castfilm in longitudinal direction, i.e. to orient it in machine direction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 17 
ComponentsThe MDO consists of:• preheating rolls• infrared heaters• stretching rolls• cooling rolls• direct drives, i.e., no gearboxes are used between drives and rollsThe necessary heating and cooling units for the MDO are located in a separatearea.At the end of the MDO an auxiliary winder (optional) is installed.3.1.2.2 Inline coating device (optional)DescriptionThe inline coating device is designed to coat the film on one side or both sides, de-pending on the model.Optionally, a corona treatment station is included which activates the film surface inorder to improve the coating of the film.3.1.2.3 Transverse direction orienterIntroductionThe transverse direction orienter stretches the already longitudinal oriented film intransverse direction.Transport, heatingThereby, the film is transported through an oven, which heats the film, by the so-called "clips". At the end of this oven cooling fans are installed to cool down the hotfilm.On top of the transverse direction orienter an exhaust system is installed to removevapours from the oven, originating from additives or from the resin.3.1.3 Finishing and winding3.1.3.1 Pull roll unitIntroductionThe purpose of the pull roll unit is to pull off the film from the track system and for-ward it to the winder unit.ComponentsThe pull roll unit contains:• Edge trim device• End film thickness gauge• Corona treatment station• Flame treatment device (optional)The end film thickness gauge and the edge trim device are assembled with the pullroll unit.The end film thickness gauge continuously measures the thickness of the film andgives information about the thickness tolerance across the width.3.1.3.2 Winder unitIntroductionThe function of the winder - a two-station turret winder with an automatic cutting unit- is to wind up the final film into so-called "jumbo rolls".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 18 
ComponentsThe winder unit contains:• Winder unit• Automatic cutting unit• Loading and unloading device (optional)The loading and unloading device unloads full mill rolls (jumbo rolls) and loadsempty cores in automatic cycle.3.2 Film properties and applicationsDefinitionThe abbreviation "BOPET" stands for Biaxially Oriented PolyEthylene Terephthal-ate.Field of applicationBy stretching the film, i.e. by orienting the macro-molecules of the polyester its prop-erties are altered as followsType of propertyValuePropertyTensile strength++Strain at break–+F-5 value++Modulus of elasticity++Thermal shrinkage–+Film density++Explanation:+ increasing/improved– decreasing/impairedRange of thicknessThe spectrum of industrial applications comprises thicknesses from less than 1 μmup to 350 μm.The most usual thicknesses are:Thickness [μm]Application1 / 2 / 2.5 / 5Capacitors5.8 / 6 / 7.5 / 9Audio-video products, capacitors, technical use8/10 / 11.5 / 12 / 15Packaging, metallizing, hot stamping, audio-videoproducts, industrial-electric uses18 / 20 / 23 / 25Miscellaneous, packaging36 / 40 / 50 / 75Computer tape, floppy discs, graphic arts100 / 125 / 175 / 190Graphic arts, mold release, micro films, LCD-monitors200 / 259 / 350Electrical insulation, stiffeners, x-ray films, LCD-monitors3.3 Raw material3.3.1 Polyester productionPolyesterPolyester belongs to the broad class of organic high-molecular weight polymers.At the present time, films made of polyethylene terephtalat, an aromic polyester,dominate the field of industrial polyester films.Polyethyleneterephtalate films are strong, tough and flexible and have low water ab-

VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 19 
Industrial uses also capitalize on their excellent dielectric properties.ProductionToday PET is mostly produced from Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) and mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) via polycondensation process.3.3.2 Resin properties

Molecular weight andintrinsic viscosity

The properties of plastic materials are determined by the structure of the polymerchain and the mutual arrangement of the ordered regions.The molecular weight of PET is determined via measurements of the intrinsic vis-cosity in solution.For film application the molecular weight of PET raw materials is in the range of15,000–20,000 g/mol.Biaxial orientated PET-films are usually made from raw materials of relatively lowmolecular weight, characterized by intrinsic viscosity (IV) values in the range of0.57–0.65 dl/g with a small viscosity variation of max. IV +/- 0.01 dl/g.For film production linear structure polyester are used. The molecular weight influ-ences a number of end use properties, e.g. mechanical properties of final film to acertain extent and in a fundamental way the processing behaviour, which stronglydepends on such basic parameters as rheological and heat transfer properties,crystallization rate, degree of molecular orientation etc.

Diethylene glycol(DEG)

The most noticeable outcome of a side reaction during PET-production is the forma-tion of diethylene glycol units in the polymer chain. The presence of these units hasa decisive influence on the melting point of PET.The optimum conditions throughout production of PET raw material from PTA andethylene glycol are necessary to carry out the reaction in such a way that the di-ethylene glycol content is less than 1.0%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 21 
Influence of DEG-content on melting pointThe thermal properties of PET are essentially affected by polycondensation cata-lysts and temperature. Carboxyl groups in PET are not only an evidence of athermal history, they also have an influence on the hydrolytical stability of polyester.The processing of PET in the extruder is carried out at temperatures of about 270–290 °C. The rate of degradation initiated under these conditions depends largely onthe temperatures as well as on the kind and amount of polycondensation catalysts.Normal values for the content of COOH-groups are between 20–30 mmol/kg with amax. deviation of ± 5 mmol/kg.

Carboxyl groups(COOH)

MoistureAt high temperatures PET reacts with moisture. Due to the influence of moisture thepolymer chains break and the average chain length becomes smaller. This phe-nomenon which is already noticeable at 160 °C and strongly manifests above themelting point is called hydrolytic degradation.Hydrolytic degradation has a big influence on the film properties and can lead toprocess problems.In order to keep hydrolytical degradation at an acceptable level, the moisture con-tent of the PET-chips before processing should be lower than 0.004% or 40 ppmand preferably between 20–30 ppm.INFOThe moisture absorption through immersion in water at 25 °C for 1 week is 0.8%.

IntroductionIntroduction

Influence of moisture content on intrinsic viscosity for different PET raw materials3.3.5 AdditivesFor the processing of BOPET-films the selection of the proper additives is very im-portant.

PurposeTheir main tasks are:• Improving windability• Improving the pinning properties• Acting as antiblocking agents• Reducing coefficient of frictionThe range of application and the film thickness determine the kind of additives, theirdistribution and concentration in the BOPET film.During the polycondensation process, the additives are mixed into the polymerwhich is then delivered to the film producer with a certain content of additives.Here, this raw material can be used 100% pure or in a mixture with other types ofPET polymers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 23 
The necessary amount of polymer mixed with additives (masterbatch) depends onthe following parameters:• The content of additives in the masterbatch itself• The type and form of the additives contained• The desired application of the end filmPackaging film for example needs an additive with very good haze propertieswhereas a very smooth additive is necessary for video film with no special demandson the optical properties.Typical additives are silica and talcum.3.4 Film processing3.4.1 Resin supply to cast filmIntroductionThis chapter contains information about the material flow from the resin supply tothe film casting unit.3.4.1.1 Material flow of raw material and regranulated materialIntroductionThis chapter contains information about the transport of resin and regranulate.Kinds of materialThe following kinds of material are used:• Virgin raw material– Usually supplied in big bags of about 1 ton each.– Transported via a conveying system to the storage silos for virgin raw mater-ial.• Regranulated material– Produced based on film fluff (recycled film).– Stored in silos for regranulated material.

Single screw ex-truders

If single screw extruders are used, the raw material is to be dried before it is fed intothe main extruder respectively a coextruder:The silos for virgin PET as well as for regranulated material are connected to dosingand mixing units from where the granulate is transported to the crystallizing and dry-ing section, directly to the single screw extruder(s).The different raw materials for the coextruder(s) are also conveyed via a mixing anddosing unit and the coextrusion crystallizer and dryer to single screw coextruder.

Twin screw extruderIn case of a twin screw extruder, the material is conveyed directly from the feedinghopper via the dosing unit into the extruder (no dryer necessary).Edge trim recyclingThe edge trim of the film is cut by blades.The edge trim of drive side and operator side is continuously sucked into a grinderand cut into film fluff. The film fluff is transported into intermediate silos or directlyinto the dosing unit of the main extruder (only if a twin screw extruder is used).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 24 
Film recycling and re-granulation

At several locations of the line, trimmed film is further cut into smaller film fluffs, e.g.,in the following grinders:• Edge trim grinder• Cast film grinder• Waste film grinderThe film fluffs of all grinders are collected in fluff silos.From the fluff silos, the film fluff pass a regranulation system where the fluffs are re-cycled to PET-granules ("Regranulate"). This regranulate is stored in suitable bagsor transported to the raw material silos by a conveying system.

3.4.1.2 Extrusion unit and melt dieIntroductionThe extrusion system melts the raw material and ejects it as a flat profile in continu-ous operation.ComponentsThe extrusion system consists of the following components:• Main extrusion system• At least one coextruder (optional)• Metering pumps• Melt filter• Adapter block (optional multi-layer)• Melt die unit (optionally multi-layer)Extruders, filters and the melt die unit are connected by adapter pieces and meltpipes.Material flowThe mixture of PET polymer and regranulated polymer is melted in the main extru-sion unit and conveyed to the main filter via the prefilter and metering pump.The main filter is used to remove contamination from the melt. This filter has a cer-tain amount of filter discs.A large filter surface in a relatively small construction is obtained by using filter discsor filter candles. Large filter areas provide a long filter life and minor pressurelosses.Then the melt flows from the filter via the melt pump and the multilayer adapterblock to the melt die.The coextruder(s) serve to melt and to convey the raw material of the skin layer.The coextruder(s) is/are connected with the melt die by similar components as themain extrusion system but smaller in size.The melt coming out of the (optionally multi-layer) adapter block is discharged bya(n) (optionally multi-layer) melt die. The single-layer melt die distributes the meltflow in even thickness across the entire width. If a 3-layer melt die is used, there isno longer a multi-layer adapter block; each layer is distributed by its own "coat-hanger".The distribution takes place in the so-called "coat-hanger" distributor.Film profileThe total profile of the film can be adjusted by means of a flexible die lip with push-pull bolts, so the die gap can be extended or closed depending of the actual filmprofile deviation from set point.The fine-tuning of the die gap profile has to be executed by adjusting the bolts of theflexible die lip either manually or fully automated by the auto-profile control system.

Melt die gapRecommended melt die gap against final film thickness:Final film thickness [μm]Melt die gap [mm]4 - 80.7 - 1.48 - 361.4 - 2.236 - 1251.8 - 2.83.4.1.3 Film casting unitIntroductionThe film casting unit pulls the melt from the melt die. In the film casting unit the filmis strengthened by cooling down. This is achieved by means of a big cooling roll,called "chill roll".Components1 Melt die2 Chill roll3 Cast film4 Pinning electrode5 Air shower cooling system (optional)CrystallizationThe crystallization of the PET-film is influenced by the cooling conditions of the chillroll.A quick cooling process of the melt influences the crystal or spherolite structure ofthe cast film in a way to keep the crystal structure as even as possible and the rateof the crystallization rather small. The melt is cooled on one side by the chill roll andon the other side by ambient air.For thick film production over 125 μm the melt is cooled from both sides. The socalled air shower cooling system is cooling the outside to reach a better and morehomogenous cooling of the melt.To get a good applying of the melt onto the chill roll a perfectly working pinning sys-tem with a clean oligomer-free electrode is necessary.3.4.1.4 Thickness gauge for cast film (optional)IntroductionGenerally a thickness gauge is integrated into the pull roll unit to measure the finalfilm thickness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 26 
An additional thickness gauge (optional) can be installed behind the film casting unitto measure the thickness of the cast film.The film thickness is measured continuously and contact-free by a cross movingbeta ray, infrared scanner or an X-ray system while production is running.The measuring data will be analysed and processed by special software which es-sentially controls the following processes:• Displaying the actual thickness across the width• Calculating and displaying the average film profile and standard deviation

Measurement (castfilm)

3.4.2 Stretching3.4.2.1 Machine direction orienterIntroductionThe machine direction orienter (MDO) orients the unstretched cast film in longitud-inal direction at a specific stretching temperature.Preheating groupTo heat up the film to the required stretching temperature a certain number of pre-heating rolls are installed.Stretching groupThe longitudinal stretching process occurs between heated stretching rolls runningwith different speeds. Additional infrared heaters across the entire width, arrangedin the stretching gap, guarantee and provide the remaining heat for stretching thefilm evenly.The film thickness after the machine direction orienter depends on the speed at theinlet of the machine direction orienter and the stretching ratio.Stretching ratioThe quotient of the roll speeds is defined as longitudinal stretching ratio SRMD:SRMD= Longitudinal stretching ratio [–]v1= Speed of the MDO rolls in front of the stretching gap [m/min]v2= Speed of the MDO rolls after the stretching gap [m/min]d1= Thickness of the cast film in front of the stretching gap [µm]d2= Thickness of the longitudinally stretched film after the stretching gap[μm]The usual stretching ratios are between 2.8 and 4.6.If the MD stretching ratio is too low it will cause excessive thickness variations inlongitudinal direction which causes difficulties in the following transverse directionstretching process in the transverse direction orienter.A raise of the longitudinal stretching ratio increases the tensile strength of the filmand reduces the elongation at break.The interdependence between these two values is shown in the following diagrams.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 27 
Cooling groupAfter stretching the longitudinally oriented film is cooled down rapidly by coolingrolls.Heating circuitsThe preheating rolls, stretching rolls, annealing rolls and cooling rolls are suppliedby their own water circuit including a heating and/or cooling unit. The rolls are tem-perature controlled individually, in pairs or up to three in series.

Tension measuringrolls

At the inlet and the outlet of the machine direction orienter tension measuring rollsmeasure the actual film tension.The tension values are displayed at the IPC monitor. Thus, the operator can adjustthe speed between the machine direction orienter and the film casting unit respect-ively the transverse direction orienter and the machine direction orienter to achievesuitable film tension.

Feeding systemFor easy film threading a motor driven threading chain pulls the cast film through theMDO.3.4.2.2 Inline coating device (optional)PurposeDepending on the model of the inline coating device, the film is coated on one sideor both sides with a coating medium.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 28 
Coating modesThe inline coating device can be operated in the following coating modes.• Coating– The film can be coated.• Bypass– The film can not be coated.RollsDriven rolls transport the film through the inline coating device.In coating mode, the gravure roll receives the coating medium from the coatingchamber and transfers it onto the surface of the film.Optionally, heating rolls and cooling rolls are contained for heating respectively cool-ing the film.Optionally, spreading rolls are contained. The film edges are always pulled outwardby the bowed shape of the spreading roll. An adjustment of the bending angle of thespreading roll is possible.Edge lifting rollsEdge lifting rolls (2 pairs of edge lifting rolls) are mounted on both sides of the coat-ing station as well as before and after the coating station.With 2 coating stations, the first pair of edge lifting rolls is before the first coatingstation and the second pair is after the second coating station.The edge lifting rolls prevent the coating of the film borders and the contamination ofparts in contact with the film. Otherwise, the film could slip out of the clips at the inletof the TDO or could could stick on the clips at the outlet of the TDO.

Film spreadingdeviceCorona treatment sta-tion (optional)

The film web is tightened in the transversal direction by the spreading device in or-der to smooth the wrinkles in the area of the coating machine, originated by thestretching of the film in longitudinal direction (machine direction orienter), and to en-sure a uniform film path.The film edges are guided between two rollers which are pressed against eachother.The film edges are always pulled outward by the slight angular position of the rollerpair. This keeps the film tight.Optionally, a corona treatment station is included.The corona treatment prepares the surface of the film for subsequent coating.The film surface is subjected to an electrical corona discharge. Due to the coronadischarge, the polarity of the surface and the surface tension is increased which en-ables better adhesion of the coating material.

3.4.2.3 Transverse direction orienterIntroductionThe transverse direction orienter, abbreviated TDO, serves to orient the longitudin-ally stretched film in the second stage into transverse direction.Thus, the film is biaxially oriented, i.e. stretched in longitudinal and in transverse dir-ection.The film is transported through the TDO by a clip system mounted on a chain andguided by a chain rail.SectionsHeating and cooling of the film is effected by a heating and cooling air stream. Thisair stream is spread evenly across the film by so-called "nozzle boxes".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 29 
Therefore the TDO is subdivided into several sections as follows:• Preheating• Stretching• Annealing• CoolingPreheatingFor the air supply and exhaust, an "external airing system" is used.Since the transverse stretching temperature is considerably higher than the temper-ature of the film at the inlet of the TDO the film must be preheated to that temperat-ure.The preheating section comprises several zones. The chain track adjustment in thissection is mainly parallel, i.e. in the preheating section the film must not bestretched at all, but transported only.If there is an inline coating device (optional) installed, the preheating section is alsoused to dry the coating continuously over the film width.StretchingIn the stretching section the distance between the chain rails is continuously exten-ded. That means the film is stretched in transverse direction.If the stretching temperature is too high, the thickness tolerances can not be main-tained. The film becomes hazier and finally breaks.Normally the transverse stretching ratio is never fixed. It’s defined over the chain railadjustment, which depends on the used polymer.The chain rail position can be adjusted by hand wheels located between the differ-ent sections.Optional the chain rail position can be adjusted fully automatically by motors.As the film edges are held by clips, the edges remain unstretched during transverseorientation.For this reason, the unstretched edges stay thicker and have to be removed afterleaving the TDO.Stretching ratioThe transverse stretching ratio could be found out by marking two parallel lines of acertain distance prior to the TDO by means of fibre pens and by measuring theselines at the end of the TDO or the winder.SRTD=Transverse stretching ratiob1=Line distance prior to transverse stretchingb2=Line distance after transverse stretchingDuring transverse stretching the film also becomes thinner in relation to the stretch-ing ratio.dTD=Film thickness after transverse stretchingdMD=Film thickness prior to transverse stretchingSRTD=Transverse stretching ratioAnnealingThe fixing station consists of a certain number of zones.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 30 
In this section, the transport system converges to thermo-stabilize the film by tem-perature and relaxation. The film width is decreased by approx. 0–5% of the size ofthe last stretching zone - depending on stretching ratio and shrinkage value.The fixing temperature is limited since too high temperatures have bad influence onthe film properties.CoolingThe TDO sections are concluded with the cooling section. In this section, the hotfilm is cooled down in a slow and defined manner by blowing temperature-controlledair onto the film.After that, the film is released from the clip system for further conveyance by the pullroll unit.TemperaturesFor further information on the temperatures, refer to the Line Operation Manual orthe Operation chapter.3.4.3 Finishing and winding3.4.3.1 Pull roll unitIntroductionThe purpose of the pull roll unit is to pull off the film from the track system and for-ward it to the winder unit.Thickness gaugeBetween the first and the second part of the pull roll unit a thickness gauge is in-stalled for measuring the thickness of the final film.

Edge trim system(optional)Web cleaning device(optional)

The edge is trimmed by blades on the drive and operator side. The width of theedge trim is approx. 120–150 mm.1 Edge trim2 Net width of final film3 CutterThe edge trim is fixed in its position by special nip rolls to establish a good conditionduring cutting of the edge trim before being pulled off by a suction nozzle.From the grinder, the fluff is blown through a piping system to the regranulation sys-tem or to the intermediate silos or the dosing unit of the main extruder.To reduce the amount of settled dust from the web surface.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 31 
It is a combination of 3 main units:• a static eliminator• a pressurized air stream• a “vacuum cleaner”After the thickness gauge for the final film, the corona treatment station follows.To avoid wrinkles during the transport and surface treatment of the film, there is acertain number of spreader rolls.To avoid slipping and a backside treatment of the film on the corona treatment roll,there is a nip roll attached. Thus, the winder cannot pull the film through the pull rollunit.

Corona treatment(optional)

3.4.3.2 Thickness gauge for final filmIntroductionGenerally a thickness gauge is integrated into the pull roll unit to measure the finalfilm thickness.

Measurement (finalfilm)

The film thickness is measured continuously and contact-free by a cross movingbeta ray scanner, infrared scanner or an X-ray system while production is running.The measuring data will be analysed and processed by special software which es-sentially controls the following processes:• Displaying the actual thickness across the width• Calculating and displaying the average film profile and standard deviation• Calculating and displaying the actual mill roll profile• Triggering of the automatic lip adjustment bolt control to adjust the die gap toreach an even thickness profile with small deviations across the width and overtime.

3.4.3.3 Winder unitIntroductionThe winder unit consists of a two-station turret winder with an automatic cutting unitand a preceding installed driven roll system, including a so called "tension measur-ing roll" and a "contact roll".With this winder it is possible to change the film rolls without interrupting the produc-tion process.Winding processWhen starting up the line, the film is wound on one winding station first. Then, themachine parameters are optimised and the film can finally be applied on the emptywinding core in the other station by the automatic cutting unit.While winding up the film on one station, the completed jumbo roll can be removedfrom the other station and an empty winding core can be put in.It is necessary to adjust the winding characteristic in order to obtain well wound filmrolls.With the visualisation software, the winding characteristic can be preset via tension/diameter and pressure/diameter diagrams, displayed on the screen.Net outputBased on the existing winding speed on the winder, the net output of the productionplant can be calculated from the film constants (width, average thickness and dens-ity).mnNet output [kg/h]

4 Raw material4.1 Handling Raw Materials4.1.1 Safety instructionsINFORaw materials and additives for films with food contact must have the relevant au-thorisations and comply with the national regulations.4.1.2 General Recommendations

Purchase of raw ma-terialsIncoming goodscheck

The purchase of raw materials must be planned sufficiently in advance. The invent-ory on hand must be large enough to bridge delivery bottlenecks and prevent pro-duction downtime. It is recommended to have several suppliers for all important rawmaterials. The majority of a raw material (for example, 60%) can be obtained fromone supplier and a smaller part (for example, 30%) can be acquired from a secondsupplier. Depending on requirements, a small part (for example, 10%) can be ob-tained from a third supplier (for example, to test new raw materials or develop newrecipes).Raw materials must be checked immediately after arrival in both the laboratory aswell as in production and the results archived. Thus, inadmissible deviations canalready be recognised in advance.Test values such as melt flow rate, xylene solubility, additive content, pellet size dis-tribution, colour of the pellets, for example, should be present for each delivery.

4.1.3 Transport and storageIntroductionThe best method is to store resin in original packing filled directly by your suppliers.However special precautions must be taken with handling and storage.GuidelinesPlease ensure that companies and personnel that are to be employed to handle ortransport these raw materials are advised as follows:• Bags and big bags or octabins must be protected from rain, snow or high humid-ity.If necessary, clean bags, big bags or octabins before entering and opening themin the raw material feeding area.• Tarpaulin covered truck loads are not sufficient or suitable for transport of rawmaterials in Monsoon or heavy rainfall conditions.• Where possible, bags should be left on wrapped pallets and handled by fork lift.• Do not use dirty silo trucks. Raw material transportation packagings should onlybe opened in a clean environment.• Where pallets have to be unloaded, care must be taken to avoid breakage ofbags.A locked dust-free warehouse giving protection from rain, excessive moisture or hu-midity, sunlight and extremes of temperature is recommended.Normal warehouse practices of batch segregation, stock rotation, cleanliness andtidiness are essential.

Additive master-batches

The slip and antistatic additives used in the production of plastic films are surfact-ants or migratory, therefore as well as being able to migrate to the surface of thefilm after manufacture they can also migrate to the surface of the granules in themasterbatch itself.As in the film, this process depends on time, temperature and air humidity. Additivemasterbatches usually have at least 6 months of shelf life after production. Storagetemperatures above 25 °C are not recommended.Masterbatches are moisture sensitive. Broken or partly used bags will let in moistureand render the masterbatch unusable. Therefore, reseal bags very carefully ortransfer the contents into special airtight containers and label well.

INFOGenerally the humidity content of all raw materials must not exceed 0.05%(500 ppm).

Details can be found in the datasheets ofthe respective raw material manufacturer. See „Raw material datasheets“.The sequence of the entries in the tables is alphabetic according to manufacturername and does not imply any valuation with respect to quality.Depending on the application of the film, further additives can be necessary.Status columnThe Status column gives information on the use of a raw material.• RecommendedRaw material for which the manufacturer has collected positive experience withregard to performance and quality in long-term runs on several lines.The use of this raw material is recommended by BRÜCKNER.• ApprovedThe manufacturer confirms good processability of this raw material on severallines.However, more experience is required in order to give the raw material the Re-commended status.• In useThis raw material is used successfully by one or more film manufacturer(s).The specified experiences and findings refer to lines of the manufacturer only.There is no correlation between the status and the maximum line speed that can beachieved with the respective raw material. Information on the possible line speedcan be found in the footnotes of the relevant table.Start-up periodThe raw materials and masterbatches required for the start up period should prefer-ably be selected by means of the following recommendations and provided in con-tainers such as Big Bags, road/trail containers, Octabins or sacks of 25 kg.Guarantee runFor the implementation of guarantee runs, only polymers and masterbatches withthe Recommended status must be used.For machines with 3-gap stretching, only materials with the attribute "Recommen-ded" in "3-gap" column may be used for guarantee runs. The intrinsic viscosity (IV)for 3-gap materials should be between 0.57 and 0.62.Viscosity valuesAll viscosity values base on specifications in data sheets or similar sources given byraw material suppliers. If no additional information is given, the value represents the„intrinsic viscosity“ determined according to ASTM D2857.

6 Film ProductsIntroductionDue to stretching of the film, i.e. due to the orientation of the macromolecules of theraw material, the film properties and consequently the fields of application change.DefinitionThe wound film after the winding process is called 'jumbo roll' in the previous andfollowing text.The processed jumbo roll is called the end product.6.1 Standard formulationsStandard formulationA formulation is an assembly of individual base materials which are combined tomanufacture a film with the required properties.Further informationFor further information and examples of standard formulations, see Examples ofstandard formulations [} 43].6.2 Handling jumbo rollsStorage conditions of jumbo rolls and the film formulation have a considerable effecton the properties of the final film.Finished jumbo rolls should be slitted as soon as possible, preferable directly afterproduction. A storage time of 1 day should in any case not be exceeded. Relativehumidity can be between 60–80%.A dust-free atmosphere is essential as dust can find its way to regranulation.6.3 Handling finished goods rolls (slit rolls)Conditions• Once the film has been cut, we recommend temperatures of storage between20–30 °C.• Storage temperatures above 35 °C are not recommended.• Rolls should be arranged either vertically or horizontally with special frames orend plates on pallets.• Film should be stored in special racks.• Do not store one pallet on another for long periods.• If special pallet lids are available to spread the load, transporting two pallets'height is admissible.A storage time of not more than 3 months without further QA inspection before de-livery to customer is recommended.

7 Examples of standard formulations7.1 IntroductionStandard formulationA formulation is an assembly of individual base materials which are combined tomanufacture a film with the required properties.Important notes• The dosing ratios in the table are given in weight percent.• All formulations are only suggestions. All raw materials may be exchanged withalternative raw materials or raw material combinations mentioned in the respect-ive lists.7.2 Notes and RecommendationsFormulation teamThe definition of the formulation is a major part of each project.It is recommended to form a team made up of the following concerned parties forthis purpose:• Sales manager• Plant manager• Chief production supervisor• Technical manager• Quality Assurance Supervisor (QA Supervisor)• Research and development supervisorThis provides a wide range of specialist knowledge of the entire range of applica-tions.Formulation details must be treated confidentially.INFODuring the start-up phase, Brückner can offer support to find the optimum film for-mulation.The film manufacturer must carry out its own evaluations to find the optimum formu-lation that is suitable for the respective application, including the storage conditions,raw materials and process variables.Number of film typesStandard formulations for proven films and applications have to be documented.New formulations must be extensively checked and tested before market introduc-tion.The number of film types required for the market should be kept as low as possible,because with every film type change, the line efficiency drops. The longer the pro-duction run for a film type, the higher the efficiency. A production run should ideallytake between five and seven days.The resulting additional costs for the storage of the film rolls will be covered in ashort period by the higher efficiency. This will also increase the flexibility, becausecustomers can quickly be provided with film from stock.

Alternative formula-tions

To maintain production in the case of delivery bottlenecks or quality problems, thedevelopment of alternative recipes is recommended.

Additional additivesAlthough some additives may not always be necessary for the end use of the film, itis sometimes recommended that small amounts are used as processing aids.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 44 
Example:• Antiblock agents reduce the blocking of the film and thereby the tendency of thefilm to wrinkle. This can occur in the vicinity of the winding core when cutting thefilm roll and lead to losses in quality. Antiblock agents facilitate the winding orcutting of the film.Storage periodThe storage period of a film, i.e. the time between manufacture and sale to the endconsumer, can be five to six months:• one month before the customer receives film from the film manufacturer• one month in his warehouse before printing• one month before delivery to the end customer• one month in the warehouse of the end customer before use• one month before the product is sold to the consumerDuring this time a considerable amount of film can be manufactured that - in thecase of negative feedback from the customer or consumer - is only second-ratequality or can no longer be sold at all.Therefore:►Maintain formulations carefully from one production run to another.►Do not make even small changes to the formulation without extensive trials.►Thoroughly test new formulations.

VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 45 
7.3 Mixing recommendationsMixingThe control of mixing or extruder feeding should be the responsibility of the ChiefProduction Supervisor via individual BO-line Shift Supervisors.The correct and constant feed of additives is of utmost importance to the consist-ency of film quality. Both Shift Supervisors and QA Supervisors have a responsibilityto ensure that correct formulations are being used.DosingThe correct and constant supply of additives is essential for consistent film quality.The best and most convenient method of additive masterbatch dosing is via gravi-metric dosing equipment for each extruder.Volumetric dosing equipment or manual or semi-automatic mixer equipment shouldonly be considered in special cases for extruder feeding.7.4 Film for general packaging purposes

9 Organisation of a film plantIntroductionA formalised structure of various departments, each with their own defined respons-ibilities is a vital requirement to ensure a smooth start-up and continued efficientrunning of a film plant.The diagram on the following page gives one form of operational organisation forthe total company which has been used successfully in a number of plants.

Main operationalgroups

The main operational groups are:• Film production• Sales• FinanceThe main operational groups report to the Board of Directors and the manager ofeach group is responsible for a range of functional activities as shown in the dia-gram.It is essential that each department works well as a motivated team and that ad-equate communication exists between departments at all levels.9.1 Departments

IntroductionThe functions of each department are summarized in the following pages with mostemphasis being given to the Plant Management activity which is responsible for filmproduction up to the point of sale.

Supporting depart-ments

Film Production has four main supporting departments as follows:• Planning:InstructionsRaw materialRetrieval of Production StatisticsProduction Statistics CoordinationRemoval of Finished Goods – Waste – Regranulation etc.• Technical:Process Help and TroubleshootingFormulation DetailsQA Services• Engineering:Planned MaintenanceBreakdown MaintenanceModificationsImprovements Required by ProductionBetter Control of Process Variables• Personnel:Support to Managers and Supervisors ProblemsImprovements in Working Methods and TrainingHelping with Interdepartmental Communications

Organisation systemand reporting rela-tionships

The overall organisation system and reporting relationships are suitable for anyscale of operation but obviously the numbers employed in each department are de-pendent on the sales volume and local factors, such as the degree of dependenceon outside services, e.g. engineering, security, etc. Especially in the technical andthe production planning and control department it is usual that more positions fromthe following table are occupied by only one person.

The film processing section has the responsibility of processing the raw materials(granules and various additive master batches) into mill rolls (jumbo rolls) of film. Itis also responsible for recycling of waste film into useable granules.The finishing section is responsible for converting the jumbo rolls into smaller rollson cardboard cores for direct sale to customers or into process rolls which are slitfor customers in a secondary slitting operation.The finishing section also includes the preparation and packing of the rolls accord-ing to orders.

OrganisationThe detailed organisation of this department is shown in the following flow chart.9.3.3 Engineering department

Engineering depart-ment

The most important task of the Engineering Manager is to ensure the continuousproduction of high quality film.All production machinery requires regular maintenance attention to work at max-imum efficiency. In order to achieve this, there must be close cooperation betweenthe production, planning and engineering departments so that maintenance periodscan be used effectively. Such periods should be planned on an annual basis. Forparticular calendar dates, maintenance periods of e.g. 8 hours, 24 hours, 2 daysshould be planned.Unplanned plant stoppages will inevitably occur and the Engineering Departmentshould be geared up to exploit these periods for maintenance purposes.

10 Quality assurance - QAIntroductionThis chapter contains important information about:• Quality assurance policy• Technical / QA department organisation• Quality assurance function• Development and research section• QA – paperwork system• Mill roll numbering systems• Production control paper10.1 Quality assurance conceptsConceptsQuality assurance can be differentiated into two different concepts:• Concept of total quality assurance• Concept of reduced quality assurance

Total quality assur-anceReduced quality as-surance

It is recommended that you use the total quality assurance concept.This implies that film quality is the responsibility of every single employee in thecompany and not just that of the quality assurance department.High quality film can only be consistently produced and delivered to the customerwhere high standards of work and quality are required from every department andevery employee of the company.This makes it possible for the company to establish itself as a reliable supplier andto more quickly penetrate the market.Because the film properties – depending on the degree of control of the numerousprocess parameters – always fluctuate within certain limits, a specification must beestablished for each film type. This involves sales, the quality assurance depart-ment, production and in some cases the customer.The goal is to keep the production of inferior film at a minimum. Inferior film must notbe delivered to customers under any circumstances. In order to achieve this, all filmproduced must be tested carefully, results must be compared to standard specifica-tions, and the film must be graded accordingly.Reduced quality assurance is limited to certain trained operators in the process sec-tion performing standard tests on the samples taken from mill rolls. Likewise, slittingmachine operators perform standard tests at the slit reels.This reduces the number of people involved in the process. Their function lies inperforming nonstandard tests, testing aged film and randomly checking slit reelquality.

INFOThe following chapters assume that total quality assurance is used.10.2 Technical / QA department organisationIntroductionQuality assurance is generally directly subordinate to the technical manager.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 68 
As a result, it is convenient to separate the technical department into three func-tional areas as follows:• Research and development (R&D)• Quality assurance for the film production process• Quality assurance for the finishing operationOrganisation chartFor a possible organisational structure, see the organigram in Quality assurance de-partment organisation [} 76].Job descriptionsJob descriptions for the following positions are contained in the chapters below:• Technical manager• QA Supervisor• Research and development supervisor10.3 Quality assurance processesOverviewAs part of the quality assurance regimen, the film must be checked for certaindefined properties immediately after it is manufactured and again three days later.Special attention needs to be paid to the properties that change over the course oftime.For newly developed film recipes, the ageing characteristics of raw materials over atleast 30 days must be monitored so that improvements and refinements can bemade.Ageing samples must be taken from every lot number and kept for at least one yearso that checks can be made in case of customer problems. Around 40 carefully la-belled films (250 mm x 300 mm) are stored for this purpose.The following chapters describe the main testing criteria in the areas of manufactur-ing and finishing and provide information on evaluation and documentation.

Checks for each filmroll

The following checks must be performed for each film roll immediately after it ismanufactured, preferably in the specified sequence.• Wetting tension (full width)• Surface tension• Average thickness• TD thickness variation (double check on thickness gauge)• Haze• Gloss• Shrinkage

Tests per shiftThe following tests must be performed at least once per shift.• Tensile strength MD – TD• Elongation MD – TD• E-modulus MD – TD• Dimensional stability• Electrical properties (optional)Other testsIn addition to the regular tests, random sample testing must be performed onsite inthe production line to test the film for its optical properties, such as the existence ofscratches and dust and to test whether there are any problems that negatively effectthe film quality.EvaluationThe results must be compared with the product specifications. Deviations from thespecifications or from the results of the previous roll may be an indication of faults inequipment parts and/or poor attentiveness on the part of the operators.Further information on documentation pertaining to quality assurance can be foundin the following chapters.10.3.4 Quality assurance in the finishing sectionFinishing sectionThe responsibility of quality assurance in the finishing section begins when the filmhas been completely wound on the jumbo rolls.The ageing process of the film begins at this time. It may vary between a minimumtime of 24 hours to three or four days.The film cannot be cut until the jumbo rolls coming from production have been re-leased by quality control. Quality control during the cutting and final testing of thecut films prior to packaging is performed by an inspector from the film cutting depart-ment. This person is trained in finishing by quality control and works together withquality assurance.Final testThe following properties are tested in the final test:• Uniformity of the rolls• Film flatness• Winding characteristics• Contamination or physical damage• Correct width, weight and film type for customers order• Label has been filled in correctlyQuality assurance in the finishing section must also spot check the cut films to en-sure that correct standards are maintained.

Daily summary ofresults

This should be completed daily by the QA supervisor and given immediately to:• Plant manager• Engineering manager• Personnel manager• Planning managerIt is important to see and check how properties vary over 24 hours of production.Small variations in results show good control of process variables and wide fluctu-ations warn of malfunctions of equipment or personnel.The wide circulation of this summary is to encourage the policy of total quality as-surance and this form should be discussed in detail at interdepartmental meetingson a daily basis. See also Quality assurance - daily summary [} 79].

10.5.5 Raw material quality reportPurposeAlthough it is difficult to perform a high number of meaningful tests on homopoly-mer, copolymer or additive masterbatches without extremely expensive equipment,a few checks should be made. This shows suppliers that each batch delivered isdocumented and that the tight quality requirements of raw materials needed for ahigh quality film production are understood. These reports can often be useful asthe basis of discussions with suppliers when they visit. See also Raw material qual-ity report [} 81].Copies must be sent to:• Plant manager• Chief production supervisor• Technical manager10.6 Labeling of mill rollsIntroductionThe finished mill rolls must be labelled with a unique ID, such as by means of anumbering system.This ID is used to identify it in all manufacturing processes. Even after delivery tothe customer, the individual mill roll can be traced back on the basis of its ID.The identification or numbering system must be defined in cooperation with otherdepartments (such as production accounting).

Four systems are introduced in the chapters below:• Timestamp system• Lot numbering system• Day numbering system• Date numbering system10.6.1 Timestamp systemDescriptionThe first part of the number indicates the film production line. The second part of thenumber specifies the timestamp.Example0A16040811310A1604081131Film production lineTimestamp (date and time)

• 0A = film production line A• 0B = film production line B• 0C = film production line C• etc.

Format [ YYMMDDhhmm ]• [ YY ] = year• [ MM ] = month• [ DD ] = day• [ hhmm ] = hour and minute in 24-hour time format

Film production line A8th April 2016, 11:31 am10.6.2 Lot numbering systemDescriptionThe first part of the number indicates the production lot. Rolls from this lot arenumbered consecutively (second part of the number).Example021-032021032Lot no.Number of the roll in the lotAdvantagesSegregates film into formulation types.DisadvantagesNo automatic date reference.Difficult for accounting purposes if daily figures are needed.Customers compare quality from different lots and state preferences.10.6.3 Day numbering systemExample16309Day no.No. of roll that day• January 1st is day number: 001.• December 31st is day number: 365.AdvantagesAccounts per day are simplified.DisadvantagesStill have to cross check date of manufacture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 03 - OperatingManual - Pag 75 
Raw material could change on the same day (possibility of slitting an incorrectly se-lected roll).• Day and date numbering is generally not changed at midnight (00:00 o'clock)but at the end of the night shift, e. g. at 06:00 a.m.• The roll number is assigned at the end of the winding process and relates to theday and date at that point in time.• The film type should be changed when the day or date data change, if possible.

Information on dayand date numbering

10.6.4 Date numbering systemDescriptionThe first part of the number is the current date (YYMMDD). Rolls from the same dayare numbered consecutively (second part of the number).Example071102-005071102005YearMonthDayNumber of the roll from that dayAdvantagesCan instantly tell date of manufacture.Daily accounting simplified.Customers can identify and use in rotation.

Testing of BOPET FilmThermal Shrinkage

BMS TT 1.107 / 2015

Testing of BOPET Film

The test is to determine the dimension stability of BOPET films (in the following referred to as"films").The thermal shrinkage according to this standard is a characteristic property for quality control. Acomprehensive judgement of the thermal shrinkage can only be made by simulating theconverting conditions.2.Definition2.1Thermal shrinkage according to this standard is the change of length l of a specimen by influenceof heat and indicated in %.

The thermal shrinkage for the conditions temperature =150 °C and time = 30 minutes is abbreviated 150/30.2.3Other conditions shall be abbreviated in the same way.3.Specimen3.1Preparation of SpecimenSpecimens are to be taken from the film track if possible uniformly spread over the full roll width.The machine direction shall be marked by a fibre pen. Specimens with visible defects on thesurface are not to be tested.3.2Dimension of SpecimenSquare film sheets with dimensions of 100 x 100 mm are cut out of the film track by means of acutting template. The main direction of the cutting template has to correspond with the maindirection of the film track.3.3Number of SpecimenAt least five specimens are to be tested. If the film width exceeds 5 m, one specimen per onemeter film width shall be taken.Page 1

Testing of BOPET FilmThermal Shrinkage

BMS TT 1.107 / 2015

Testing of BOPET Film

For cutting a high-grade steel template with dimensions of 100 x 100 mm 0,1 mm is used. Theedges may not be rounded off. There should be a handle for easier handling of the device.4.2RulerFor measuring the specimens a ruler with a linear graduation of 0,5 mm shall be used.4.3Heating CabinetAll types of heating cabinets can be used. The temporary temperature deviation of the heatingoven must not exceed more than 1 °C. At half height of the cabinet a sheet made of stainlesssteel should be mounted. The steel sheet should be covered with a paper sheet to avoid stickingof the film onto the steel sheet.4.4Stop-WatchFor timing the testing period any type of stop-watch with an accuracy of 1 s/h can be used.5.StorageThe film or the specimens to be tested are taken right after production and tests shall be madewithin 3 hours after finishing production.Between termination of production and the tests the film must not be exposed to extremeambient conditions.There shall be standard conditions of 23/50 as per DIN EN ISO 291.There should be considered that the characteristics of the film may change during storage due topost-crystallization. Therefore a control measurement after a storage period of 14 day isrequired.Prior to this control measurement the film or the specimens should be stored in standardconditions for 24 hours..Page 2

BrücknerInternalStandard6.Procedure

Testing of BOPET FilmThermal Shrinkage

BMS TT 1.107 / 2015

Testing of BOPET Film

The specimens are taken from the film track as per 3.1 and cut on an even base plate by meansof a cutting template.After having marked the direction of the film track the width of the specimen is measured in bothmain directions.It shall be taken care that the ruler is always positioned exactly vertically to both main directions.The specimen is measured in its centre.Specimens which dimensions deviate more than 0,3 mm (estimated) from the templatedimensions are not to be tested.Before testing the heating cabinet shall be preheated to testing temperature for at least 30minutes in order to obtain a constant temperature. The test shall be performed in calm air.The film shelf shall be slightly powered with talc in order to avoid that the film will stick on themetal sheet.The heating cabinet may only be opened for a moment in order to put in the specimen. Openingthe cabinet door may not exceed 15 s.The specimens are put side by side onto the shelf.Right after closing the cabinet door the stop-watch must be started.After a required testing period the specimens are taken out of the heating cabinet.Before measuring the specimens shall have cooled off the room temperature. The width of thespecimens must be measured in both main directions exactly to 0,5 mm and recorded in themeasuring report.Page 3

Testing of BOPET FilmThermal Shrinkage

BMS TT 1.107 / 2015

Testing of BOPET Film

For the single results of each main direction the arithmetical average value shall be determined.The thermal shrinkage can be calculated according to following formula:l150/30 = (l0 - l1) / l0 x 100 %Since the original measuring length l0 has been 100 mm (= 100 %), the thermal shrinkage canalso be calculated by following formula:l150/30 = (100mm - l1) x 1 %/mmMeanings of abbreviations:lthermal shrinkage in %l1measuring length in mm after testingl0original measuring length in mm8.Test ReportWith respect to this standard the test report has to contain following data:- kind and nomenclature of the tested film- number of tested specimens

- thermal shrinkage in both main directions in % rounded off to the first two value indicatingfigures- deviations from this standard- production date of film- test dateExplanations:Due to certain production conditions it may happen that the film shows anincrease of length in one of the two main directions. The "shrinkage" then is referred to asnegative thermal shrinkage, calculated according to aforementioned formulas, and is indicated asa negative numerical value.Page 4
