3 Control roomIntroductionThere are two control rooms at the film production line (see previous figure).Every control room contains one or more computes and one operator panel. Thevisualisation enables easy and user-friendly communication with the film productionline via the control knobs.One control room, preferably control room 1, has to be manned by qualified operat-ing personnel during operation. The personnel has to be able to react to all opera-tional states and processes which are not covered by the Process Control System.

A detailed description of the control knobs on the operator panels can be found inthe chapter "Operator panels".NameplateThe nameplate is used for the unique identification of the film production line (FPA).It is attached in the control room 1 so it is clearly visible.The nameplate always contains the following fields:The fields have the following meanings:FieldDescriptionKom.Nr.:Commission numberMaschine:Line abbreviationStruktur:Structure number of the complete lineBaujahr:Year of construction of the line

5 Emergency stop facilitiesDescriptionAn emergency stop is carried out by manual actuation of a trigger or by the controlof the film production line. To reduce the danger, actions such as switching off thecomponents are triggered. Operation of the components is prevented by emergencystop locks. The emergency stop locks are reset by setting the start release.If further triggers are actuated during an active emergency stop, the start releasemust also be set for them.

VOLUME 01 - OperatingManual-LineOverview - Pag 151 
8.1 Pressure exceeded in the extrusion systemDescriptionIn the parts of the extruding process that are melt-guiding, the pressure of the meltis continuously measured with pressure transducers and monitored by the processcontrol system. If the maximum permissible pressure is exceeded, the alarm for theaffected pressure transducer is displayed on the visualisation and protective func-tions are carried out. The protective functions should prevent any damage or explo-sion in the melt-guiding parts.Protective functionsThe following protective functions are carried out:• The drives of the extrusion system are switched off and locked.• The heating in the affected extrusion line, except for the adapter block and themelt die, is switched off and locked.• The "Overpressure/Overtemperature" acoustic signal sounds on the horn at thevacuum system or at the front area of the melt die unit.• The flash lamp on the vacuum system or the front area of the melt die unitflashes.• The "Overpressure/Overtemperature" acoustic signal and the flash lamp are de-activated when the measured pressure no longer exceeds the maximum per-missible pressure. This can take several hours.

Temperature in thevacuum pump unitexceeded

The "Overpressure/Overtemperature" acoustic signal also sounds and the flashlamp flashes at the vacuum system or at the front area of the melt die unit in case ofan exceedance of temperature at the exhaust air collecting line of the vacuum pumpunit.

Protection measure►If the "Overpressure/Overtemperature" acoustic signal sounds and theflash lamp flashes, immediately leave the extrusion system danger zone.Eliminating the causeThe search for the cause may only be carried out by an instructed specialist. Thesearch for the cause is carried out outside the extrusion system danger zone. Onlywhen safe access is ensured, the extrusion system danger zone may be entered.Searching for the causeCauseMeasure

• By switching off the drives andthe heating, the pressure in theparts that carry melt dropsslowly.The "Overpressure/Overtem-perature" acoustic signal andthe flash lamp are deactivatedwhen the measured pressureno longer exceeds the max-imum permissible pressure.This can take several hours.• The alarm from a temperaturesensor is displayed on the partsthat carry melt.• Often the extrusion line is beingheated.

• There is a problem on the tem-perature sensor. See sub-sequent section "Eliminating amalfunction on the component".• Overheated heating zoneDue to incorrect heating andcooling during heating, part ofthe plastic was heated upstrongly and evaporated. Sincethe remaining plastic is stillsolid, the overpressure wasgenerated.

ü The "Overpressure/Overtem-perature" acoustic signal andthe flash lamp are not active.►Remove and clean all parts thatcarry melt. Determine and re-move the cause of the block-age. The cause can be a for-eign body or plastic that has notmelted.►Eliminate the malfunction onthe temperature sensor.

8.2 Temperature in the vacuum pump unit exceededDescriptionIn the exhaust air collecting line of the vacuum pump unit, the temperature of thegases is continually measured with a temperature controller and monitored by theprocess control system. If the maximum permissible temperature is exceeded formore than 5 seconds, the alarm for the temperature controller is displayed on thevisualisation and protective functions are carried out. The reason for the temperat-ure exceedance could be a fire in the exhaust air collecting line.Protective functionsThe following protective functions are carried out:• The drives in the vacuum pump unit are switched off and locked.• The slow-action air blower in the vacuum pump unit switches off with a delay of5 minutes.• The "Overpressure/Overtemperature" acoustic signal sounds on the horn at thevacuum system or at the front area of the melt die unit.• The flash lamp on the vacuum system or the front area of the melt die unitflashes.• The "Overpressure/Overtemperature" acoustic signal and the flash lamp are de-activated when the measured temperature in the connection sleeve of the ex-haust collecting line no longer exceeds the maximum permissible temperature.This can take several hours.

Pressure exceeded inthe extrusion system

If the pressure in the melt carrying parts of the extrusion is exceeded, the "Over-pressure/Overtemperature" acoustic signal sounds and the flash lamp flashes at thewarning facilities at the melt die unit.

Protection measure►If the "Overpressure/Overtemperature" acoustic signal sounds and theflash lamp flashes, immediately leave the extrusion system danger zone.Eliminating the causeThe search for the cause may only be carried out by an instructed specialist. Thesearch for the cause is carried out outside the extrusion system danger zone. Onlywhen safe access is ensured, the extrusion system danger zone may be entered.Searching for the causeCauseMeasure

• By switching off the drives inthe vacuum pump unit, the tem-perature in the exhaust air col-lecting line decreases.The "Overpressure/Overtem-perature" acoustic signal andthe flash lamp are deactivated.
