1 FunctionIntroductionThis chapter contains information on the intended use and the description of the ba-sic functions of the components. Here, above all, those functions that are necessaryfor operation and maintenance have been taken into account.In addition, this chapter contains a description of the active and passive safeguards.1.1 Intended useIntended useThe pull roll unit is part of the film production line. It takes over the film from the pre-ceding machine and transfers the film to the following machine. The pull roll unitalso carries out thickness measurement, surface treatment and cuts off the edgetrim.The machine is contractually specified by parameters and must only be operatedwithin them.DisclaimerAny use that goes beyond the designated use is forbidden. Brückner accepts no li-ability for any consequential damage. Improper use can present danger to life andlimb, the machine and connected equipment, and to the efficient operation of themachine.

Risk assessment andwork instructions

The operating company has to carry out a risk assessment and create operating in-structions for the handling of the machine.Inputs listed in this operating manual for personal protective equipment are basedon the risk assessment taking into consideration the experience with film productionand film stretching lines. The actually occurring hazards can deviate in individualcases. In this case, the measures of the hazard assessment of the operating com-pany must be taken into consideration and applied.

Overview

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 11 - OperatingManual-PullRollUnit - Pag 10 
In the pull roll unit, the film runs through the following production steps:• Cutting to net width• Thickness measurement• Surface treatment• Tension isolation and transport to the winder unitPneumatic systemAll movements for closing and opening devices are started up pneumatically. To doso, the pull roll unit is connected to the pneumatic system of the line.Spreading deviceThe spreading device tightens the film path in the transverse direction to reduce thewrinkle formation and to ensure a more even film path.The film edges are guided between two spreading rollers which are pressed againsteach other.Thickness gaugeThe thickness gauge measures the thickness profile of the film non-contacting andcontinuously with a radiator source.

Part nip roller devicefor the edge area

The part nip rollers are positioned in the edge area of the drive side and the operat-ing side in each case. They tension the film in the edge area. The part nip rollerspress the edge areas of the film against the heating and cooling roll or the guide rollin order to prevent sudden movements of the edge trim.

Edge trim deviceThe edge trim device cuts the edge strip on both sides, thereby producing the netfilm width.The edge trim can be recycled into the process.Cutting dust exhaustThe cutting dust exhaust removes dust particles that occur at the cut edges.

Edge trim choppingdevice

The edge trim chopping device removes the edge trim which was cut off by theedge trim device.

Treatment stationIn the treatment station, the film surface is prepared for the following processing(e.g. printing or metallising).Discharge deviceThe film is discharged over the entire film width to prevent electrostatic charging ofthe components to be further processed.Nip rollThe nip roll presses the film against a driven roll. It thereby helps to prevent the oc-currence of air bubbles between the film and the roll.RollsThe type and the surface of the rolls are described in chapter Technical data[} 117].1.3 SafeguardsSafeguardsAn overview of the safeguards can be found in the "Line overview" operatingmanual.Information on the safeguards can be found in the "Safety manual".1.4 Process control system
