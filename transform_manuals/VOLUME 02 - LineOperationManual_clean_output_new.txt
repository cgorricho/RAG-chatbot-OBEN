Transmitting the"Line ThreadingMode"

Linking typesThe speeds of the individual machines of a line can be linked.There are two types of links:• Linking beginning at the chill roll("Auto Mode" or "Tandem Mode")• Linking of the extrusion system and chill roll("Extruder Automatic Mode" or "Extruder Slave Mode")

Master of the linespeed

For the line speed, the chill roll is the master. If the speed of the chill roll is changed,the speeds of the linked machines change proportionally.

9.5.1 Linking beginning at the chill rollThe speed of the chill roll of the film casting unit can be linked to the speeds of thedownstream line components.Generally, the speed is linked during the start-up of the film production line, begin-ning at the chill roll when activating the line threading modes. To do so, the ma-chines are linked with the speed of the chill roll one after the other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 02 - LineOperationManual - Pag 115 
The linkings beginning at the chill roll can also be activated manually.
