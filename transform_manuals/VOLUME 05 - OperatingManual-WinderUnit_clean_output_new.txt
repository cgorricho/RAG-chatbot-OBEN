1 FunctionIntroductionThis chapter contains information on the intended use and the description of the ba-sic functions of the components. Here, above all, those functions that are necessaryfor operation and maintenance have been taken into account.In addition, this chapter contains a description of the active and passive safeguards.1.1 Intended useIntended useThe winder unit is the last machine in the stretching line.The winder unit takes up the film from the previous line component and wraps thefilm into a roll.The machine is contractually specified by parameters and must only be operatedwithin them.Winding coresOnly winding cores suitable for the line component may be used. The winding coresmust fulfil the specifications of Brückner.DisclaimerAny use that goes beyond the designated use is forbidden. Brückner accepts no li-ability for any consequential damage. Improper use can present danger to life andlimb, the machine and connected equipment, and to the efficient operation of themachine.

Risk assessment andwork instructions

The operating company has to carry out a risk assessment and create operating in-structions for the handling of the machine.Inputs listed in this operating manual for personal protective equipment are basedon the risk assessment taking into consideration the experience with film productionand film stretching lines. The actually occurring hazards can deviate in individualcases. In this case, the measures of the hazard assessment of the operating com-pany must be taken into consideration and applied.

1 Cutting and lay-on arm2 Reversing wheel drive3 Reversing wheel4 Winding core5 Mill roll6 Operator panel7 Contact roll8 Tension measuring roll9 Discharge device10 Spreading device and edge chargedevice

11 Charge device on the cuttingarm

12 Cross cutting device

The winder unit takes up the film from the previous machine, wraps it into rolls andmakes it available for further processing.OscillationThe winder unit oscillates parallel to the oscillating edge trim device in the pull rollunit. Thus, the film borders of the mill roll do not lie on top of one another and thefilm is uniformly coiled onto the mill roll.

Tension measuringroll

The tension measuring roll measures the film tension in front of the contact roll. Thevalues are displayed on the monitor of the operator panel.

Spreading deviceThe spreading device tightens the film path in the transverse direction to reduce thewrinkle formation and to ensure a more even film path.The film edges are guided between two spreading rollers which are pressed againsteach other.Discharge deviceThe film is discharged over the entire film width to reduce electrostatic charging ofthe components to be further processed.Edge charge deviceThe edge charge device electrostatically charges the film in the edge area on theoperating side and the drive side.The charging of the film edge prevents telescoping of the film.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUME 05 - OperatingManual-WinderUnit - Pag 9 
Cutting and lay-onarm

After the mill roll is turned into the loading/unloading position, the cutting and lay-onarm is swivelled from the park position into the working position. After replacementof the winding core, the film is cut off across the entire width. While cutting off thefilm, the film is laid around the new winding core.The cutting and lay-on arm supports the cross cutting device and the charge device.The cross cutting device guides the film holding device during the cutting.The charge device electrostatically charges the area of the film margin on the oper-ating side. The charging of the film supports the placing of the film cutting edge onthe winding core during the cutting process.

Contact rollThe contact roll presses the film against the winding core to reduce air pocketsbetween the layers of film.Turning unitThe turning device changes the winding cores. As soon as a film roll is full, thewinding position and the loading/unloading position of the winding cores are ex-changed by the turning process and the film is coiled onto the empty winding core.Winding core driveIn order to wind up the film, each winding station is driven by one winding coredrive. The drive adapts the speed of the winding core automatically to the film pathspeed. At the same time, the speed decreases with increasing mill roll diameter.Winding core chuckThe winding core chuck clamps the winding cores between the cones of the operat-ing side and the drive side on the winding stations.The crowning of the winding core changes with increasing mill roll diameter. Due toa self-aligning bearing, the flexible cones compensate the curve of the winding core.An interlocking system prevents opening during the wrapping.Core ejectorThe core ejector ejects the winding core out of the winding core chuck. The mill rollcan hence be removed and replaced by an empty winding core.

Hydraulic, electricaland pneumatic sys-tem

All movements for closing and opening devices are started up hydraulically, elec-tromechanically or pneumatically. To do this, the winder unit is connected to the rel-evant system of the line.

1.3 SafeguardsSafeguardsAn overview of the safeguards can be found in the "Line overview" operatingmanual.Information on the safeguards can be found in the "Safety manual".1.4 Process control system

Process control sys-tem

The winder unit is controlled and visualised by the Process Control System. Theprocess control system from Brückner is called IPC (Integrated Process Control).WinCC OA is the visualisation of the process control system. The visualisation en-ables easy and user-friendly communication with the winder unit via the controlknobs.The following control knobs are available:• Operator panels• Individual control knobs• Computer in the control room or the control roomsInformation on the control knobs can be found in the "Line overview" operatingmanual.
