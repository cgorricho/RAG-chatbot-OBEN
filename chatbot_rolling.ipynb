Thus,\\nwhen winding up the film, the air inclusion between the film layers of the mill roll is\\nreduced. The building up mill roll pushes the contact roll backward in its linear guid-\\nance. The contact pressure is continually controlled.\\nFor contact winding, the following values can be set:\\n•Pressure of the contact roll on the mill roll depending on the mill roll diameter\\n•Tension of the mill roll depending on the mill roll diameter\\nGap winding\\n1Contact roll 2Mill roll\\n3Gap\\nDuring gap winding, a constant gap is maintained between the contact roll and the\\nmill roll.
