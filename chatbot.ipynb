      "Los pasos para poner en marcha un motor pueden variar dependiendo del tipo de motor y del sistema específico. A continuación, se presentan algunos pasos generales basados en el contexto proporcionado:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Precalentamiento del Motor**:\n",
      "   - Operar el sistema de calentamiento del agua de enfriamiento.\n",
      "   - Asegurarse de que el agua de calentamiento circule a través de los cilindros durante al menos 2 horas antes de arrancar.\n",
      "   - La temperatura del agua debe ser adecuada según el tipo de combustible (HFO: >60°C, MDO: >40°C).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Preparación del Sistema de Combustible**:\n",
      "   - Drenar los tanques de combustible para eliminar agua y verificar los filtros.\n",
      "   - Comprobar el nivel del tanque de combustible y rellenar si es necesario.\n",
      "   - Verificar el sistema de enfriamiento para el aceite diesel.\n",
      "   - Para arranques en HFO, asegurarse de que el motor esté precalentado y listo para la circulación de HFO.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Secuencia de Arranque**:\n",
      "   - Si el motor está configurado para CAN, las ECU compatibles reciben el comando de arranque a través de CAN y transmiten la velocidad del motor al controlador DSE.\n",
      "   - El temporizador de retardo de arranque comienza para permitir solicitudes de arranque \"falsas\".\n",
      "   - Si la solicitud de arranque persiste al final del temporizador de retardo, se energiza el relé de combustible y se arranca el motor.\n",
      "   - Si el motor no arranca durante el intento de arranque, el motor de arranque se desengancha durante la duración del descanso de arranque y luego se realiza el siguiente intento.\n",
      "   - Si la secuencia continúa más allá del número establecido de intentos, la secuencia de arranque se termina y se muestra \"Fallo al Arrancar\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Verificación de la Dirección de Rotación**:\n",
      "   - Iniciar la bomba y verificar la dirección de rotación.\n",
      "   - Continuar ventilando la bomba mientras se abre un poco más la válvula de aislamiento de descarga.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Verificación de la Presión y Temperatura del Aceite**:\n",
      "   - Asegurarse de que la presión de entrada de aceite antes del turbocompresor de gases de escape sea adecuada.\n",
      "   - Verificar la temperatura del aceite lubricante antes del turbocompresor de gases de escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Verificación de Conexiones y Fusibles**:\n",
      "   - Verificar que la correa de tierra del chasis esté conectada correctamente.\n",
      "   - Asegurarse de que B+ esté debidamente fusionado.\n",
      "   - Verificar que las señales de habilitación del conductor y del interruptor de llave estén fusionadas.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Comprobación de la Secuencia de Encendido**:\n",
      "   - Usar un osciloscopio para verificar el perfil de corriente del inyector mientras se usa un modo de prueba.\n",
      "   - Verificar que cada salida esté conectada al cilindro correcto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estos pasos son una guía general y pueden necesitar ser adaptados según el tipo específico de motor y las instrucciones del fabricante.\n",
